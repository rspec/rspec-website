    h2 Let's get started!

    p
      | To kick things off, install RSpec and run <code>rspec --init</code> to
        set up your project to use RSpec.
    = asciinema_video 14095, speed: 3

    p
      | Start with a very simple example that expresses some basic desired
        behaviour.
    = asciinema_video 14100, speed: 4

    p Run the example and watch it fail.
    = asciinema_video 14101, speed: 2

    p
     | Implement that basic behaviour...
    = asciinema_video 14102, speed: 2

    p Run the example and bask in the joy that is green.
    = asciinema_video 14103, speed: 2

    h3 Take very small steps
    p
      | Don’t rush ahead with more code. Instead, add another example and let
        it guide you to what you have to do next. And don’t forget to take time
        to refactor your code before it gets messy. You should keep your code
        clean at every step of the way.

        | The RSpec Book will introduce you to RSpec, Cucumber, and a number of other tools that make up the Ruby BDD family. Replete with tutorials and practical examples, the RSpec Book will help you get your BDD on, taking you from executable requirements to working software that is clean, well tested, well documented, flexible and highly maintainable.

      p
        | The Testing Ruby Applications with RSpec screencast introduces the core RSpec libraries through the development of a small CLI card game. In addition to covering the technical aspects of using RSpec, it also covers best practices for using them so you get the most out of your test suite: different types of tests, what kinds of things to test, when different styles are appropriate.
